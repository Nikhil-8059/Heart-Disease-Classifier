# Heart-Disease-Classifier

This project follows the **Data Science Lifecycle**, a process designed for addressing big data challenges through structured steps. By applying these steps, we aim to build a machine learning model to classify heart disease using the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset**.

---

## Data Science Lifecycle Overview
The data science lifecycle consists of the following seven steps:
1. **Problem Definition**: Define the objective and scope of the project.
2. **Data Collection**: Gather the required dataset(s).
3. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
4. **Data Exploration**: Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and insights.
5. **Data Modeling**: Build and train machine learning models.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics and validation techniques.
7. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the model for practical use or integration.

## Project Objective
In this project, we will:
- **Build a Heart Disease Classifier**  
- Use the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset** to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of **14 attributes** and the target variable. Below is a description of each attribute:

| **Attribute** | **Description** |
|---------------|------------------|
| `age`         | Age in years. |
| `sex`         | Sex (1 = male; 0 = female). |
| `cp`          | Chest pain type:<br> - 0: Typical angina<br> - 1: Atypical angina<br> - 2: Non-anginal pain<br> - 3: Asymptomatic |
| `trestbps`    | Resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital). |
| `chol`        | Serum cholesterol (mg/dl). |
| `fbs`         | Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false). |
| `restecg`     | Resting electrocardiographic results:<br> - 0: Normal<br> - 1: ST-T wave abnormality<br> - 2: Left ventricular hypertrophy |
| `thalach`     | Maximum heart rate achieved. |
| `exang`       | Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no). |
| `oldpeak`     | ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest. |
| `slope`       | Slope of the peak exercise ST segment:<br> - 0: Upsloping<br> - 1: Flat<br> - 2: Downsloping |
| `ca`          | Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy. |
| `thal`        | Thalassemia:<br> - 3: Normal<br> - 6: Fixed defect<br> - 7: Reversible defect |
| `target`      | Heart disease status:<br> - 1: No heart disease<br> - 2: Presence of heart disease |

## Steps to Be Followed
1. **Load the Dataset**: Import the UCI Heart Disease Dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, scale features, and encode categorical variables.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize relationships and correlations between variables.
4. **Model Building**: Train classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees).
5. **Model Evaluation**: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate performance.
6. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the classifier for real-world use.
